            A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of
            ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are
            often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments
            such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce," often a variation of
            Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger
            patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.[1]

            The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the
            United Kingdom, where the term patty is rarely used or can even refer to ground beef.
            Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with

            burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger. In Australia
            and New Zealand, a piece of chicken breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger, which
            would generally not be considered to be a burger in the United States; Americans would
            generally call it a chicken sandwich, but in Australian English and New Zealand English
            a sandwich requires sliced bread (not a bun), so it would not be considered a
            sandwich.[2][3]
